# Featured-Content

Featured Content consists of two components which are used to pin featured or important files and libraries to the community. This allows community users fast access to the files which are currently of highest importance.

Highlights:

- Display up to 5 featured libraries and 6 featured files for community users to navigate. Featured libraries can also be customized with images through the community builder.
- Switch between list and tile view of the library content to suit personal preference.
- Preview or download files through both components by simply clicking the desired file. Available through all device types.

Additional Details:

The Featured Content components allow community administrators to choose which files and libraries should be pinned to a community through the community builder. From here the admin can not only choose the files to feature, but also change the titles displayed over each component and customize the featured libraries with images.

The libraries component supports subfolders in addition to a wide range of file types, from image files to powerpoints and even content packs. Each file can also be previewed and downloaded through each component. Users can also switch between tile and list views in each library to suit their personal preference.
